        "- **Project Objective:** The primary goal was to analyze Uber's request data to identify the root causes of the supply-demand gap, specifically focusing on \"Cancelled\" trips and \"No Cars Available\" for airport-city routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Overview:** The analysis utilized a dataset of 6,745 ride requests, featuring variables such as Request ID, Pickup Point, Status and Timestamps.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Methodology & Tools:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    **1. Excel:** Used for initial data cleaning, formatting mixed timestamps, and creating an interactive dashboard with slicers for business stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **2. Python (Pandas/NumPy):** Employed for advanced feature engineering, including the creation of Time Slots (Early Morning, Day Time, Evening, Late Night) and a Gap Status indicator.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **3. SQL:** Used to perform high-level aggregations and identify peak failure hours through complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Findings - The \"Evening\" Gap:**\n",
        "    - The most severe supply-demand gap occurs during the Evening slot (5 PM – 10 PM), with a failure rate of approximately 66.5%.\n",
        "    - The root cause is a massive shortage of supply at the Airport, where riders frequently receive \"No Cars Available\" messages due to high arrival demand and insufficient driver presence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Findings - The \"Early Morning\" Gap:**\n",
        "    - A secondary peak in the gap occurs during the Early Morning slot (5 AM – 10 AM).\n",
        "    - The primary issue here is Driver Cancellations for trips originating in the City. This suggests drivers avoid airport trips in the morning because they fear a lack of return fares from the airport back to the city.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Overall Performance:** The analysis revealed a low overall trip completion rate of only 42%, highlighting a significant loss in potential revenue and customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Actionable Recommendations:**\n",
        "   - **For the Airport (Evening):** Implement targeted driver incentives and surge pricing to encourage drivers to move toward the airport during peak arrival hours.\n",
        "   - **For the City (Morning):** Introduce cancellation penalties for drivers during peak morning hours and provide \"return trip\" guarantees to make airport runs more attractive.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Business Impact:** By addressing these specific temporal and spatial gaps, Uber can optimize its driver distribution, increase successful trip counts, and significantly improve the reliability of its service for airport commuters."

        "    - **Cancellations:** Drivers frequently cancel requests, especially for trips heading toward the airport during specific hours.\n",
        "    - **No Cars Available:** Riders often face situations where no drivers are nearby to accept their requests, leading to unfulfilled demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Impact on Stakeholders:**\n",
        "    - **For Riders:** These gaps lead to a poor user experience, long wait times and unreliability for critical travel (like catching a flight).\n",
        "    - **For Drivers:** Inefficient distribution of cars means drivers might miss out on high-demand periods or spend too much time on unprofitable routes.\n",

High numbers of **“No Cars Available” cases and cancellations** lead to lost revenue and poor customer experience. Demand patterns are **predictable by hour and day**, which provides a strong opportunity for proactive planning. By improving **driver availability during peak times**, using **location- and time-based incentives**, and reducing cancellations through better matching and scheduling, Uber can significantly **increase trip completion rates, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance**.\n"
